blockchain/cryptocurrency with Node.js

This is the beginning of my journey to the world of web3 / blockchain technologies.

This little project is just an implementation of a blockchain/cryptocurrency app built with Node.js.
It is just an aproximation to understand the mechanisms of the blockchain technology in a simple way.

Thanks to Frank Joseph who has written this article:

from where I have taken this code as part of my process of learning.

Things I have learnt:

1. Blockchain is a digital records of transactions (blocks). We can think of it as a public legder or database.
2. Records are shared amongst the nodes in a computer network.
3. This second feature makes a blockchain decentralised and distributed.
4. Cryptography is used to ensure security.
5. Properties of a block:
* Proof of work: How much effort does a computer require to get a block hash?
* Hash: ID from cryptographic calculation.
* Timestamp
* Index
* Data
* Previous blockâ€™s hash --> This is the link forming the 'block-chain'.
